Overview
--------

**secpRod**is an open source package for the analysis and calculation of secondary production for populations and communities in R. **secpRod** uses data from repeated sampling of population abundance and size structure in a tall data structure as the base object. In addition to estimating secondary production for communities with multiple methods, **secpRod** also allows the user to visualize population data to assess best methods for secondary production estimation.
