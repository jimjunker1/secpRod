Overview
--------

**secpRod** is an open source package for the analysis and calculation of secondary production for populations and communities in R. **secpRod** uses data from repeated sampling of population abundance and size structure in a tall data structure and a taxon information sheet as the base objects. In addition to estimating secondary production for communities with multiple methods, **secpRod** also provides a tools to perform data processing actions common in the workflow prior to calculation, such as length to mass conversions using length\~mass relationships and visualizing population density and size structure to aid the determination of cohort structure and assess best methods for secondary production estimation.

Installation
------------

```r
# To install the latest version Github:
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github("jimjunker1/secpRod")
```
Status: Active Development

Usage
--------




<!-- secpRod has XX functions related to data organization: -->

<!-- - `frac_merge` takes raw count data and provides areal and subsampling adjustments. This function includes QA/QC checks for un-paired fractions and returns size-class abundance standardized to area. -->
<!-- - `mass_adj` combines  -->

<!-- secpRod has XX functions related to data visualization: -->

<!-- - `len_freq` combines data returned from `frac_merge` to taxon-level histograms -->
<!-- - `allen_curve` takes  -->

<!-- `calc_production` is the main function of secpRod. This function estimates bootstrapped secondary production from multiple methods determined in the `taxaInfo` object. -->
