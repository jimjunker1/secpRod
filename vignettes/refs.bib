Additionally, multi-trophic interactions that link processes across trophic levels have received increasing attention as a possible key driver. Given that both are integral to natural ecosystems, their interactive effect should be evident but has remained hidden. We address this issue by analysing diversity\textendash productivity relationships in a simulation experiment of producer communities nested within complex food-webs, manipulating resource-use complementarity and multi-trophic animal richness. We show that these two mechanisms interactively create diverse communities of complementary producer species. This shapes diversity\textendash productivity relationships such that their joint contribution generally exceeds their individual effects. Specifically, multi-trophic interactions in animal-rich ecosystems facilitate producer coexistence by preventing competitive exclusion despite overlaps in resource-use, which increases the realised complementarity. The interdependence of food-webs and producer complementarity in creating biodiversity\textendash productivity relationships highlights the importance to adopt a multi-trophic perspective on biodiversity\textendash ecosystem functioning relationships.},

When resource managers choose a particular landscape configuration, their decision affects both the mean abundance of species and the temporal variation in abundances. Population stability and related phenomena have economic value, because management actions affect the variance of ecosystem components. In our example, a larger reserve size is recommended when accounting for the stability of the managed ecosystem.},

Variability, however, often depends on external factors that act as disturbances, which makes comparisons across systems difficult to interpret. Here, we show how variability can reveal inherent stability properties of ecological communities. This requires that we abandon one-dimensional representations, in which a single variability measurement is taken as a proxy for how stable a system is, and instead consider the whole set of variability values generated by all possible stochastic perturbations. Despite this complexity, in species-rich systems, a generic pattern emerges from community assembly, relating variability to the abundance of perturbed species. Strikingly, the contrasting contributions of different species abundance classes to variability, driven by different types of perturbations, can lead to opposite diversity\textendash stability patterns. We conclude that a multidimensional perspective on variability helps reveal the dynamical richness of ecological systems and the underlying meaning of their stability patterns.},

  abstract = {Univariate and multivariate methods are commonly used to explore the spatial and temporal dynamics of ecological communities, but each has limitations, including oversimplification or abstraction of communities. Rank abundance curves (RACs) potentially integrate these existing methodologies by detailing species-level community changes. Here, we had three goals: first, to simplify analysis of community dynamics by developing a coordinated set of R functions, and second, to demystify the relationships among univariate, multivariate, and RACs measures, and examine how each is influenced by the community parameters as well as data collection methods. We developed new functions for studying temporal changes and spatial differences in RACs in an update to the R package library(``codyn''), alongside other new functions to calculate univariate and multivariate measures of community dynamics. We also developed a new approach to studying changes in the shape of RAC curves. The R package update presented here increases the accessibility of univariate and multivariate measures of community change over time and difference over space. Next, we use simulated and real data to assess the RAC and multivariate measures that are output from our new functions, studying (1) if they are influenced by species richness and evenness, temporal turnover, and spatial variability and (2) how the measures are related to each other. Lastly, we explore the use of the measures with an example from a long-term nutrient addition experiment. We find that the RAC and multivariate measures are not sensitive to species richness and evenness and that all the measures detail unique aspects of temporal change or spatial differences. We also find that species reordering is the strongest correlate of a multivariate measure of compositional change and explains most community change observed in long-term nutrient addition experiment. Overall, we show that species reordering is potentially an understudied determinant of community changes over time or differences between treatments. The functions developed here should enhance the use of RACs to further explore the dynamics of ecological communities.},

We investigated the effects of multiple facets of biodiversity \textendash{} species richness and composition of the community, and intraspecific diversity in two key species \textendash{} on both production and resistance of experimentally-assembled biological soil crusts (biocrusts). We found that productivity was most strongly influenced by community composition (variation in the presence and relative proportions of community members), and weakly positively influenced by species richness. Intraspecific diversity, encompassing both the richness and composition of clones, had a neutral effect on community productivity within one focal species (Syntrichia caninervis), but a moderately negative effect on productivity within the other focal species (S. ruralis). Resistance was also most strongly influenced by community composition, although different sets of species contributed most to resistance and production. Resistance was not affected by either species richness or intraspecific diversity in either focal species. Our findings supported our general expectation that community-level facets of biodiversity would be more influential than intraspecific diversity within a species because trait variability among species is usually greater than that within. These results also indicated that although species richness is often thought to strongly affect both productivity and resistance, the presence, absence and relative abundance of particular species may be more influential to both. Simultaneous manipulation of multiple facets of biodiversity in experiments may lead to a more complete understanding of the variety of ways in which biodiversity may regulate ecological systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract Compensatory dynamics are an important suite of mechanisms that can stabilize community and ecosystem attributes in systems subject to environmental fluctuations. However, few experimental investigations of compensatory dynamics have addressed these mechanisms in systems of real-world complexity, and existing evidence relies heavily on correlative analyses, retrospective examination, and experiments in simple systems. We investigated the potential for compensatory dynamics to stabilize plankton communities in plankton mesocosm systems of real-world complexity. We employed four types of perturbations including two types of nutrient pulses, shading, and acidification. To quantify how communities responded to these perturbations, we used a measure of community-wide synchrony combined with spectral analysis that allowed us to assess timescale-specific community dynamics, for example, whether dynamics were synchronous at some timescales but compensatory at others. The 150-d experiment produced 32-point time series of all zooplankton taxa in the mesocosms. We then used those time series to evaluate total zooplankton biomass as an aggregate property and to evaluate community dynamics. For three of our four perturbation types, total zooplankton biomass was significantly less variable in systems with environmental variation than in constant environments. For the same three perturbation types, community-wide synchrony was much lower in fluctuating environments than in the constant environment, particularly at longer timescales (periods {$\approx$} 60~d). Additionally, there were strong negative correlations between population temporal variances and the level of community-wide synchrony. Taken together, these results strongly imply that compensatory interactions between species stabilized total biomass in response to perturbations. Diversity did not differ significantly across either treatments or perturbation types, thus ruling out several classes of mechanisms driven by changes in diversity. We also used several pieces of secondary evidence to evaluate the particular mechanism behind compensatory responses since a wide variety of mechanisms are hypothesized to produce compensatory dynamics. We concluded that fluctuation dependent endogenous cycles that occur as a consequence of consumer?resource interactions in competitive communities were the most likely explanation for the compensatory dynamics observed in our experiment. As with our previous work, scale-dependent dynamics were also a key to understanding compensatory dynamics in these experimental communities.},

Because observed ecological stability depends on sampling scales and environmental context, it is notoriously difficult to compare measurements across sites and systems. Here, we apply stochastic dynamical systems theory to derive general statistical scaling relationships across time, space, and ecological level of organisation for three fundamental stability aspects: resilience, resistance, and invariance. These relationships can be calibrated using random or representative samples measured at individual scales, and projected to predict average stability at other scales across a wide range of contexts. Moreover deviations between observed vs. extrapolated scaling relationships can reveal information about unobserved heterogeneity across time, space, or species. We anticipate that these methods will be useful for cross-study synthesis of stability data, extrapolating measurements to unobserved scales, and identifying underlying causes and consequences of heterogeneity.},

However, the relative importance of different facets of biodiversity underlying the diversity\textendash stability relationship remains unclear. Here we use data from 39 grassland biodiversity experiments and structural equation modelling to investigate the roles of species richness, phylogenetic diversity and both the diversity and community-weighted mean of functional traits representing the `fast\textendash slow' leaf economics spectrum in driving the diversity\textendash stability relationship. We found that high species richness and phylogenetic diversity stabilize biomass production via enhanced asynchrony in the performance of co-occurring species. Contrary to expectations, low phylogenetic diversity enhances ecosystem stability directly, albeit weakly. While the diversity of fast\textendash slow functional traits has a weak effect on ecosystem stability, communities dominated by slow species enhance ecosystem stability by increasing mean biomass production relative to the standard deviation of biomass over time. Our in-depth, integrative assessment of factors influencing the diversity\textendash stability relationship demonstrates a more multicausal relationship than has been previously acknowledged.},

Second, we found that community stability is fostered by mean trophic level, while contrary to expectation, it is decreased by species richness. Finally, we found that environmental conditions affect both biomass and its stability mainly via effects on richness and network structure. Strikingly, the effect of species richness on community stability was mediated by population stability rather than synchrony, which contrasts with results from single trophic communities.

  abstract = {Under global change, how biological diversity and ecosystem services are maintained in time is a fundamental question. Ecologists have long argued about multiple mechanisms by which local biodiversity might control the temporal stability of ecosystem properties. Accumulating theories and empirical evidence suggest that, together with different population and community parameters, these mechanisms largely operate through differences in functional traits among organisms. We review potential trait-stability mechanisms together with underlying tests and associated metrics. We identify various trait-based components, each accounting for different stability mechanisms, that contribute to buffering, or propagating, the effect of environmental fluctuations on ecosystem functioning. This comprehensive picture, obtained by combining different puzzle pieces of trait-stability effects, will guide future empirical and modeling investigations.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have long been interested in how communities change over time. Addressing questions about community dynamics requires ways of representing and comparing the variety of dynamics observed across space. Until now, most analytical frameworks have been based on the comparison of synchronous observations across sites and between repeated surveys. An alternative perspective considers community dynamics as trajectories in a chosen space of community resemblance and utilizes trajectories as objects to be analyzed and compared using their geometry. While methods that take this second perspective exist, for example to test for particular trajectory shapes, there is a need for formal analytical frameworks that fully develop the potential of this approach. By adapting concepts and procedures used for the analysis of spatial trajectories, we present a framework for describing and comparing community trajectories. A key element of our contribution is the means to assess the geometric resemblance between trajectories, which allows users to describe, quantify, and analyze variation in community dynamics. We illustrate the behavior of our framework using simulated data and two spatiotemporal community data sets differing in the community properties of interest (species composition vs. size distribution of individuals). We conclude by evaluating the advantages and limitations of our community trajectory analysis framework, highlighting its broad domain of application and anticipating potential extensions.},

  abstract = {In this article, we explain an often overlooked process that may significantly contribute to positive correlations between measures of species diversity and community stability. Empirical studies showing positive stability-diversity relationships have, for the most part, used a single class of stability (or, more accurately, instability) measures: the temporal variation in aggregate community properties such as biomass or productivity. We show that for these measures, stability will essentially always rise with species diversity because of the statistical averaging of the fluctuations in species' abundances. This simple probabilistic process will operate in the absence of any strong species interactions, although its strength is driven by the relative abundances of species, as well as by the existence of positive or negative correlations in the fluctuations of species. To explore the possible importance of this effect in real communities, we fit a simple simulation model to Tilman's grassland community. Our results indicate that statistical averaging might play a substantial role in explaining stability-diversity correlations for this and other systems. Models of statistical averaging can serve as a useful baseline for predictions of community stability, to which the influences of both negative and positive species interactions may then be added and tested.},

  abstract = {Understanding how diversity affects ecosystem stability is crucial for predicting the consequences of continued habitat and biodiversity loss on ecosystem functions and services. Long-term productivity stability in plant communities is often associated with greater species, phylogenetic or functional diversity, more complex size and age structures, or higher asynchrony in species fluctuations (compensatory dynamics), all potentially increasing community resistance to perturbations. However, the relative importance of these stabilizing pathways is still poorly understood, especially in old-growth species-rich forests. Here we explore how compensatory dynamics and multiple facets of diversity underpin temporal stability of wood biomass production over forty years in a Japanese temperate forest, based on more than 45 500 stem increments from 15 species. Whereas the effect of species richness and phylogenetic diversity was small, the old-growth structural attributes markedly increased community stability via increased asynchrony in the performance of co-occurring species. Greater standing tree volume, stem density and interspecific variation in growth rates enhanced productivity stability both directly and indirectly via increased asynchrony. This corroborates the predictions of increased compensatory dynamics with increased asymmetric competition for light in a more productive environment. Asymmetric competition in old-growth patches, between dominant oaks and sub-canopy shade-tolerant firs and maples, is a major driver of productivity stability over time via compensatory dynamics. Overall productivity remains relatively constant in old-growth patches, as abundant firs and maples in the lower canopy layers compensate for biomass losses in canopy oaks caused by aging, wind and snow disturbances. Younger forest patches, composed of fast-growing, shade-intolerant species, had a lower stability of productivity, with reduced stem basal area and tree density due to higher understory bamboo coverage preventing tree regeneration and growth. We provide new insights into mechanisms underlying the stability of ecosystem functioning in diverse forest ecosystems, and emphasize the importance of preserving and supporting old-growth forests and their structural complexity.},

Collectively, these measures encapsulate the overall `stability' of the system. Many international bodies, including the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, broadly aspire to maintain or enhance ecological stability. Such bodies frequently use terms pertaining to stability that lack clear definition. Consequently, we cannot measure them and so they disconnect from a large body of theoretical and empirical understanding. We assess the scientific and policy literature and show that this disconnect is one consequence of an inconsistent and one-dimensional approach that ecologists have taken to both disturbances and stability. This has led to confused communication of the nature of stability and the level of our insight into it. Disturbances and stability are multidimensional. Our understanding of them is not. We have a remarkably poor understanding of the impacts on stability of the characteristics that define many, perhaps all, of the most important elements of global change. We provide recommendations for theoreticians, empiricists and policymakers on how to better integrate the multidimensional nature of ecological stability into their research, policies and actions.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity has been shown to increase the temporal stability of community and ecosystem attributes through multiple mechanisms, but these same mechanisms make less consistent predictions about the effects of richness on population stability. The overall effects of biodiversity on population and community stability will therefore depend on the dominant mechanisms that are likely to vary with the nature of biodiversity loss and the degree of environmental variability. We conducted a mesocosm experiment in which we generated a gradient in zooplankton species richness by directly manipulating dominant species and by allowing/preventing immigration from a metacommunity. The mesocosms were maintained under either constant or variable nutrient environments. Population, community, and ecosystem data were collected for five months. We found that zooplankton population and community stability is enhanced in species-rich communities in both constant and variable environments. Species richness increased primarily through the addition of species with low abundance. The communities that were connected to a metacommunity via immigration were the most diverse and the most stable, indicating the importance of both metacommunity dynamics and rare species for stability. We found little evidence for selection effects or overyielding as stabilizing forces. We did find support for asynchronous dynamics and statistical averaging, both of which predict destabilizing effects at the population level. We also found support for weak interactions, which predicts that both populations and communities will become more stable as richness increases. In order to understand the effects of biodiversity loss on stability, we will need to understand when different stabilizing mechanisms tend to operate but also how multiple mechanisms interact.},

Hence the composition of species assemblages is an integrative response variable, and its variability can be explained by the complex interplay among several structuring factors. The thorough analysis of spatial variation in species assemblages may help infer processes shaping ecological communities. We suggest that ecological studies would benefit from the combined use of the classical statistical models of community composition data, such as constrained or unconstrained multivariate analyses of site-by-species abundance tables, with rapidly emerging and diversifying methods of spatial pattern analysis. Doing so allows one to deal with spatially explicit ecological models of beta diversity in a biogeographic context through the multiscale analysis of spatial patterns in original species data tables, including spatial characterization of fitted or residual variation from environmental models. We summarize here the recent progress for specifying spatial features through spatial weighting matrices and spatial eigenfunctions in order to define spatially constrained or scale-explicit multivariate analyses. Through a worked example on tropical tree communities, we also show the potential of the overall approach to identify significant residual spatial patterns that could arise from the omission of important unmeasured explanatory variables or processes.},

  abstract = {At large scales, the mechanisms underpinning stability in natural communities may vary in importance due to changes in species composition, mean abundance, and species richness. Here we link species characteristics (niche positions) and community characteristics (richness and abundance) to evaluate the importance of stability mechanisms in 156 butterfly communities monitored across three European countries and spanning five bioclimatic regions. We construct niche-based hierarchical structural Bayesian models to explain first differences in abundance, population stability, and species richness between the countries, and then explore how these factors impact community stability both directly and indirectly (via synchrony and population stability). Species richness was partially explained by the position of a site relative to the niches of the species pool, and species near the centre of their niche had higher average population stability. The differences in mean abundance, population stability, and species richness then influenced how much variation in community stability they explained across the countries. We found, using variance partitioning, that community stability in Finnish communities was most influenced by community abundance, whereas this aspect was unimportant in Spain with species synchrony explaining most variation; the UK was somewhat intermediate with both factors explaining variation. Across all countries, the diversity\textendash stability relationship was indirect with species richness reducing synchrony which increased community stability, with no direct effects of species richness. Our results suggest that in natural communities, biogeographical variation observed in key drivers of stability, such as population abundance and species richness, leads to community stability being limited by different factors and that this can partially be explained due to the niche characteristics of the European butterfly assemblage.},

Recent experiments suggest that climate change can impact how plant diversity influences ecosystem stability, but most evidence of the biodiversity\textendash stability relationship obtained to date comes from local studies performed under a limited set of climatic conditions. Here, we investigate how climate mediates the relationships between plant (taxonomical and functional) diversity and ecosystem stability across the globe. To do so, we coupled 14 years of temporal remote sensing measurements of plant biomass with field surveys of diversity in 123 dryland ecosystems from all continents except Antarctica. Across a wide range of climatic and soil conditions, plant species pools, and locations, we were able to explain 73\% of variation in ecosystem stability, measured as the ratio of the temporal mean biomass to the SD. The positive role of plant diversity on ecosystem stability was as important as that of climatic and soil factors. However, we also found a strong climate dependency of the biodiversity\textendash ecosystem stability relationship across our global aridity gradient. Our findings suggest that the diversity of leaf traits may drive ecosystem stability at low aridity levels, whereas species richness may have a greater stabilizing role under the most arid conditions evaluated. Our study highlights that to minimize variations in the temporal delivery of ecosystem services related to plant biomass, functional and taxonomic plant diversity should be particularly promoted under low and high aridity conditions, respectively.},

There are few large-scale empirical tests of stability-diversity-synchrony relationships and those mostly focus on the terrestrial realm. Moreover, the effect of synchrony is largely unknown when species only covary at either high or low extremes of abundance (i.e., tail-dependent synchrony), a common phenomenon in ecological communities. Here, we synthesized long-term community time-series data (20+ years of species' abundances/biomass for 2,668 communities across 7 taxonomic groups) from both terrestrial and freshwater realms and explored how the relationships among richness, synchrony, and stability vary across realms. We also investigated the effect of tail-dependent synchrony on stability across 714 freshwater and 1,954 terrestrial communities. For terrestrial communities, we found a positive diversity-stability relationship and that the taildependent synchrony was a more important determinant of stability than the traditional measure of overall synchrony (i.e., based on the covariation of all species). For freshwater communities, only overall synchrony explained some variation in stability. Assessing tail-dependent synchrony can improve our ability to understand why stability varies across different ecosystems and thereby our inferences about the causes of human-mediated biodiversity loss.},

Current estimates suggest strikingly slow change in traditional measures of biodiversity. These estimates seem to contradict rapid shifts in the abundance of individual species and have led to a rethinking of the mechanisms shaping biodiversity. Conceptual models emphasise the role of competition among species or, more recently, selection on species identity (i.e. selection that favours some species at the expense of others). However, it is difficult to quantify how these mechanisms contribute to biodiversity change. To illustrate this point, we present cases where strong competition or selection on species identity leads to no biodiversity change. In view of this disconnect, we develop a new approach to studying biodiversity change using the Price equation. We show that biodiversity change responds to selection on species' rarity, rather than to either competition or selection on species identity. We then show how this insight can be used to quantify the effects of the mechanisms previously thought to influence biodiversity: (1) selection, (2) (ecological) drift, (3) immigration and (4) speciation. Our results suggest the connection between species' fates and their rarity is fundamental to understanding biodiversity change.},

  abstract = {Determining the relative importance of local and regional processes for the distribution of population abundance is a fundamental but contentious issue in ecology. In marine systems, classical theory holds that the influence of demographic processes and dispersal is confined to local populations whereas the environment controls regional patterns of abundance. Here, we use spatial synchrony to compare the distribution of population abundance of the dominant mussel Mytilus californianus observed along the West Coast of the United States to that predicted by dynamical models undergoing different dispersal and environmental treatments to infer the relative influence of local and regional processes. We reveal synchronized fluctuations in the abundance of mussel populations across a whole continent despite limited larval dispersal and strong environmental forcing. We show that dispersal among neighboring populations interacts with local demographic processes to generate characteristic patterns of spatial synchrony that can govern the dynamic distribution of mussel abundance over 1,800 km of coastline. Our study emphasizes the importance of dispersal and local dynamics for the distribution of abundance at the continental scale. It further highlights potential limits to the use of ``climate envelope'' models for predicting the response of large-scale ecosystems to global climate change.},

  abstract = {The diversity\textendash stability debate is a long-standing issue in ecology, asking whether more diverse communities show higher stability over time and more rapid recovery from disturbances. Connection to undisturbed habitats is thought to affect compositional and functional stability after disturbances. Therefore, we established marine phytoplankton metacommunities consisting of three microcosms (local patches), which were connected by tubes opened for different time intervals to create 5 levels of connectivity. We performed two experiments differing by homogeneous (HOM) or heterogeneous (HET) supply of irradiance across patches. As disturbance we either removed 75\% of the algal biomass locally from one randomly chosen patch, or 25 or 75\% regionally from each local patch. By comparing these treatments to an undisturbed control, we analyzed resilience (rate of recovery) and final recovery (recovery ratio) with regard to biomass (functional stability) and species composition (structural stability). In both experiments (HET, HOM), functional and structural aspects of stability responded significantly to connectivity and disturbance treatments. Functional resilience was enhanced by increasing connectivity (HET and HOM), which partially also increased functional recovery (HET) and structural resilience (HOM). By contrast, the treatment-induced gradients in diversity (species richness and evenness) had no clear effect on functional resilience or recovery. Instead, structural and functional resilience were strongly correlated regardless of patch quality, indicating that only a full recovery in community composition ensured functional stability. Our findings suggest that connectivity plays a pivotal role in maintaining ecosystem stability under pulse disturbance such that a more complete understanding of stability requires spatially explicit approaches.},

  abstract = {Asynchronous fluctuations of populations are essential for maintaining stable levels of biomass and ecosystem function in landscapes. Yet, understanding the stabilization of metacommunities by asynchrony is complicated by the existence of multiple forms of asynchrony that are typically studied independently: Community ecologists, for instance, focus on asynchrony within and among local communities, while population ecologists emphasize asynchrony of populations in metapopulations. Still, other forms of asynchrony, such as that which underlies the spatial insurance effect, are not captured by any existing analytical frameworks. We therefore developed a framework that would in one analysis unmask the stabilizing roles of local communities and metapopulations and so unify these perspectives. Our framework shows that metacommunity stabilization arises from one local and two regional forms of asynchrony: (1) asynchrony among species of a local community, (2) asynchrony among populations of a metapopulation, and (3) cross-community asynchrony, which is between different species in different local communities and underlies spatial insurance. For each type of stabilization, we derived links to diversity indices and associated diversity\textendash stability relationships. We deployed this framework in a set of rock pool invertebrate metacommunities in Discovery Bay, Jamaica, to partition sources of stabilization and test their dependence on diversity. Cross-community asynchrony was the dominant form of stabilization, accounting for {$>$}60\% of total metacommunity stabilization despite being undetectable with existing frameworks. Environmental variation influenced types of stabilization through different mechanisms. pH and dissolved oxygen, for example, increased asynchrony by decorrelating local species, while salinity did so by changing the abundance structure of metapopulations. Lastly, all types of asynchrony depended strongly on different types of diversity (alpha, metapopulation, and beta diversity drove local, metapopulation, and cross-community asynchrony, respectively) to produce multiple diversity\textendash stability relationships within metacommunities. Our new partition of metacommunity dynamics highlights how different elements\textemdash from local communities to metapopulations\textemdash combine to stabilize metacommunities and depend critically on contrasting environmental regimes and diversities. Understanding and balancing these sources of stability in dynamic landscapes is a looming challenge for the future. We suggest that synthetic frameworks which merge ecological perspectives will be essential for grasping and safeguarding the stability of natural systems.},

  abstract = {The world is spatially autocorrelated. Both abiotic and biotic properties are more similar among neighboring than distant locations, and their temporal co-fluctuations also decrease with distance. P. A. P. Moran realized the ecological importance of such `spatial synchrony' when he predicted that isolated populations subject to identical log-linear density-dependent processes should have the same correlation in fluctuations of abundance as the correlation in environmental noise. The contribution from correlated weather to synchrony of populations has later been coined the `Moran effect'. Here, we investigate the potential role of the Moran effect in large-scale ecological outcomes of global warming. Although difficult to disentangle from dispersal and species interaction effects, there is compelling evidence from across taxa and ecosystems that spatial environmental synchrony causes population synchrony. Given this, and the accelerating number of studies reporting climate change effects on local population dynamics, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the implications of global warming for spatial population synchrony. However, a handful of studies of insects, birds, plants, mammals and marine plankton indicate decadal-scale changes in population synchrony due to trends in environmental synchrony. We combine a literature review with modeling to outline potential pathways for how global warming, through changes in the mean, variability and spatial autocorrelation of weather, can impact population synchrony over time. This is particularly likely under a `generalized Moran effect', i.e. when relaxing Moran's strict assumption of identical log-linear density-dependence, which is highly unrealistic in the wild. Furthermore, climate change can influence spatial population synchrony indirectly, through its effects on dispersal and species interactions. Because changes in population synchrony may cascade through food-webs, we argue that the (generalized) Moran effect is key to understanding and predicting impacts of global warming on large-scale ecological dynamics, with implications for extinctions, conservation and management.},

The ecological Price equation promises to meet this need by organizing many different species-level changes into a few ecologically meaningful categories that sum to total ecosystem function change. Current versions of the ecological Price equation focus on species richness and presence-absence. However, abundance and relative abundance are better estimated in samples and are likely showing a stronger response to global change. Here we present a novel, abundance-based version of the ecological Price equation in both discrete and continuous forms and explain the similarities and differences between this method and a related, previously developed richness-based method. We also present new empirical techniques for applying the Price equation to ecological data. Our two demonstration analyses reveal how additive effects of increasing abundance on total function are modified by concurrent selection effects due to shifts in species' composition, as well as intraspecific change in species' per-capita function. The ecological Price equations derived here complement existing approaches, and together offer BEF researchers analytical tools and a unifying framework for studying biodiversity-ecosystem function in observational community data.},

In a series of decade-long experiments in temperate grassland, Hautier               et al.               manipulated nitrogen, water, carbon dioxide, herbivory, and fire. In all cases, plant species diversity was important for preserving ecosystem function during environmental change.

Data from 12 multiyear experiments that manipulate important anthropogenic drivers, including plant diversity, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, fire, herbivory, and water, show that each driver influences ecosystem productivity. However, the stability of ecosystem productivity is only changed by those drivers that alter biodiversity, with a given decrease in plant species numbers leading to a quantitatively similar decrease in ecosystem stability regardless of which driver caused the biodiversity loss. These results suggest that changes in biodiversity caused by drivers of environmental change may be a major factor determining how global environmental changes affect ecosystem stability.},

Experiments show that local plant species loss reduces ecosystem functioning and services, but the role of spatial homogenization of community composition and the potential interaction between diversity at different scales in maintaining ecosystem functioning remains unclear, especially when many functions are considered (ecosystem multifunctionality). We present an analysis of eight ecosystem functions measured in 65 grasslands worldwide. We find that more diverse grasslands\textemdash those with both species-rich local communities ({$\alpha$}-diversity) and large compositional differences among localities ({$\beta$}-diversity)\textemdash had higher levels of multifunctionality. Moreover, {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-diversity synergistically affected multifunctionality, with higher levels of diversity at one scale amplifying the contribution to ecological functions at the other scale. The identity of species influencing ecosystem functioning differed among functions and across local communities, explaining why more diverse grasslands maintained greater functionality when more functions and localities were considered. These results were robust to variation in environmental drivers. Our findings reveal that plant diversity, at both local and landscape scales, contributes to the maintenance of multiple ecosystem services provided by grasslands. Preserving ecosystem functioning therefore requires conservation of biodiversity both within and among ecological communities.},

However, the empirical validation of these indicators lag behind their theoretical developments.

There has been a profusion of metrics proposed to quantify stability, of which only a handful are used commonly. Furthermore, studies typically quantify one to two metrics of stability at a time and in response to a single perturbation, with some of the main environmental pressures of today being the least studied. We argue that we need to build on the existing consensus and strong theoretical foundation of the stability concept to better understand its multidimensionality and the interdependencies between metrics, levels of organisation and types of perturbations. Only by doing so can we make progress in the quantification of stability in theory and in practice, and eventually build a more comprehensive understanding of how ecosystems will respond to ongoing environmental change.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities are assembled in a spatial\textendash temporal continuum. However, we still have a poor understanding of the relative importance of different mechanisms structuring community composition (i.e. beta-diversity) in space and time. In this study, we start by introducing a conceptual model that capitalizes upon the core-occasional species concept to predict that the assembly process in tropical mountains is driven by the deterministic turnover of core species in space via habitat sorting, but the turnover of occasional species through time via stochastic events of colonization and local extinctions. We then propose a general analytical framework that allows assessing these predictions by partitioning the total variance of a species-by-site-by-time matrix (i.e. total beta-diversity) among its purely spatial (variation in space independent of time), purely temporal (variation in time independent of space) and spatiotemporal (i.e. variation across different sites across different moments in time) components. Through simulation models, we provided theoretical support that the proposed analytical framework is suitable to test the predictions derived from our conceptual model. We then used this framework to identify general patterns and quantify the relative importance of processes underlying the spatial and temporal organization of ten distinct insect metacommunities along a tropical elevational gradient. As predicted, we found that, across taxa, spatial beta-diversity was mainly explained by environmental variation alone: a pattern that indicates the spatial turnover of core species. In contrast, temporal beta-diversity could not be distinguished from the expectation of null models where communities are simply represented by random draws from species pools: a pattern that indicates a temporal turnover of occasional species within communities. Taken together, our findings illustrate how our conceptual model and quantitative framework can articulate a better understanding of community assembly in space and time.},

  abstract = {One of the few generalities in ecology, Taylor's power law1,2,3, describes the species-specific relationship between the temporal or spatial variance of populations and their mean abundances. For populations experiencing constant per capita environmental variability, the regression of log variance versus log mean abundance gives a line with a slope of 2. Despite this expectation, most species have slopes of less than 2 (refs 2, 3\textendash 4), indicating that more abundant populations of a species are relatively less variable than expected on the basis of simple statistical grounds. What causes abundant populations to be less variable has received considerable attention5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12, but an explanation for the generality of this pattern is still lacking. Here we suggest a novel explanation for the scaling of temporal variability in population abundances. Using stochastic simulation and analytical models, we demonstrate how negative interactions among species in a community can produce slopes of Taylor's power law of less than 2, like those observed in real data sets. This result provides an example in which the population dynamics of single species can be understood only in the context of interactions within an ecological community.},

Compensatory dynamics may be produced by negative interactions among species, such that the decrease in abundance of a species releases the suppression of another species and allows it to increase. We conducted a mesocosm experiment in Trout Lake, Wisconsin, USA, to test the hypothesis that compensatory shifts in species abundances play a role in overall planktonic community response to pH perturbation. In 2000-L mesocosms over a period of six weeks, we contrasted a control treatment with two acidified treatments (press, sustained pH = 4.7; and pulse, alternating pH = 4.7 and ambient pH). In the acidified treatments, we saw changes in abundance of the major zooplankton and phytoplankton species, but we observed few cases of compensatory dynamics. Nonetheless, when present, compensatory dynamics could be strong. Analyses using autoregressive models revealed negative interactions among species that could potentially lead to compensatory dynamics. However, this potential for compensatory dynamics was not realized in cases where all species were sensitive to the pH perturbations. Therefore, compensatory dynamics that buffer community responses to perturbations may be limited in communities in which many species are sensitive to the perturbation.},

We define temporal stability as the ratio of mean abundance to its standard deviation. Interestingly, the temporal stability of entire communities is predicted to increase fairly linearly, without clear saturation, as diversity increases. Species composition is predicted to be as important as diversity in affecting community stability and productivity. The greater temporal stability of more diverse communities is caused by higher productivity at higher diversity (the ``overyielding'' effect), competitive interactions (the ``covariance'' effect), and statistical averaging (the ``portfolio'' effect). The relative contribution of each cause of temporal stability changes as diversity increases, but the net effect is that greater diversity stabilizes the community even though it destabilizes individual populations. This theory agrees with recent experiments and provides a degree of resolution to the diversitystability debate: both sides of the longstanding debate were correct, but one addressed population stability and the other addressed community stability.},

  abstract = {Ecological stability has long been considered to change over succession, but how secondary succession influences the relationship between diversity and temporal stability of biomass production at different spatial scales is poorly understood. We studied changes in plant diversity, functional temporal stability (biomass production) and compositional temporal stability (the latter two are hereafter referred to as functional stability and compositional stability) and explored the stabilizing roles of plant diversity at two spatial scales (small plots of 0.25 m2 and large transects of 1.25 m2) during secondary succession in a subalpine meadow from 2003 to 2010. Our results showed that both plant diversity and functional and compositional stability increased at the small plot scale and large transect scale during secondary succession. As secondary succession proceeded, higher average alpha diversity (i.e. species diversity at the plot scale) led to higher functional and compositional stability at the plot scale by mainly species stability, predominantly contributing to higher functional and compositional stability at the large transect scale. In addition, Simpson-based beta diversity (i.e. compositional dissimilarity among communities within the same transect), while unaffected by succession, contributed to functional stability at the large transect scale by promoting asynchronous dynamics among communities. Synthesis. Our study highlights the stabilizing effects of plant diversity across the two spatial scales during secondary succession. Our findings provide the first empirical evidence that biodiversity-mediated effects on ecosystem temporal stability strengthen over successional time, suggesting that the stabilizing effects of biodiversity should be considered across spatial and temporal scales in the face of global changes and biodiversity loss.},

  abstract = {Abstract The assumption that greater biodiversity enhances ecosystem stability, commonly known as ?portfolio effect?, has attracted considerable research attention. However, the potential portfolio effects on spatial stability (the similarity of ecosystem functioning among forest communities) are still poorly examined especially at different spatial scales and under varying environmental stress conditions. Accordingly, this study investigates the biodiversity?spatial stability relationship among regional communities across different spatial scales and environmental conditions in a temperate forest region. We define spatial stability as the invariability of the productivity of woody plants among plots within a regional community. To test spatial stability, the N closest plots to a given plot were aggregated to form regional communities representing different spatial scales. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate how biodiversity (including taxonomic [TD] and phylogenetic diversity [PD]) increases spatial stability via species asynchrony and/or population stability across spatial scales. Hierarchical Bayesian modelling was used to evaluate the environmental dependence of the portfolio effects on spatial stability. TD and PD both increased the spatial stability by increasing asynchrony, but decreased population stability. The portfolio effect of TD on spatial stability became stronger and reached saturation at the intermediate scale and then decreased as regional communities became larger. The portfolio effects of TD were weaker under the stressful conditions of drought, high precipitation seasonality and high elevation but unchanged across temperature seasonality and human disturbance. PD showed no discernable effect on spatial stability and did not change across spatial scale and environmental condition. Our results suggest that the positive effect of biodiversity on species asynchrony overcomes the negative biodiversity effect on population stability to buffer the spatial change in productivity in diverse communities. Future research of the biodiversity?spatial stability relationship may thus benefit from incorporating different spatial scales and environmental conditions into the analysis.

For example, by driving grassland plant species loss, nitrogen (N) addition can reduce ecosystem stability. In other cases, however, N addition may alter productivity and ecosystem stability, by increasing the dominance of particularly productive or stable species. We examined how N addition affected plant diversity, productivity and the temporal stability of productivity in an 8-year grassland experiment. We found that N addition enhanced productivity and decreased ecosystem stability throughout the experimental period, even though it reduced species richness in the first 4 years, but increased richness during the subsequent years. During the early years, N addition decreased ecosystem stability by synchronizing species fluctuations and population stability of the dominant species. During later years, N addition did not increase stability, even though it increased species richness; instead, N addition continued to decrease ecosystem stability by decreasing species dominance and stability of the dominant species, without changing the identity of the dominant species. Synthesis. Our results indicate that N addition decreased ecosystem stability via mechanisms that were both dependent and independent of plant diversity, and that the mechanisms involved shifted over time. N addition impacted on ecosystem functioning through species richness and the effects on species dominance and the stability of most dominant species, highlighting the join effect of multiple biotic drivers in regulating ecosystem stability.},

Several experiments have provided evidence that reduced species diversity may impair ecosystem processes such as plant biomass production1,2,3,4,5. The interpretation of these experiments, however, has been controversial6,7,8,9,10,11,12 because two types of mechanism may operate in combination6,13,14,15. In the `selection effect', dominance by species with particular traits affects ecosystem processes. In the `complementarity effect', resource partitioning or positive interactions lead to increased total resource use. Here we present a new approach to separate the two effects on the basis of an additive partitioning analogous to the Price equation in evolutionary genetics16,17,18,19. Applying this method to data from the pan-European BIODEPTH experiment4 reveals that the selection effect is zero on average and varies from negative to positive in different localities, depending on whether species with lower- or higher-than-average biomass dominate communities. In contrast, the complementarity effect is positive overall, supporting the hypothesis that plant diversity influences primary production in European grasslands through niche differentiation or facilitation.},

  abstract = {Independent species fluctuations are commonly used as a null hypothesis to test the role of competition and niche differences between species in community stability. This hypothesis, however, is unrealistic because it ignores the forces that contribute to synchronization of population dynamics. Here we present a mechanistic neutral model that describes the dynamics of a community of equivalent species under the joint influence of density dependence, environmental forcing, and demographic stochasticity. We also introduce a new standardized measure of species synchrony in multispecies communities. We show that the per capita population growth rates of equivalent species are strongly synchronized, especially when endogenous population dynamics are cyclic or chaotic, while their long-term fluctuations in population sizes are desynchronized by ecological drift. We then generalize our model to nonneutral dynamics by incorporating temporal and nontemporal forms of niche differentiation. Niche differentiation consistently decreases the synchrony of species per capita population growth rates, while its effects on the synchrony of population sizes are more complex. Comparing the observed synchrony of species per capita population growth rates with that predicted by the neutral model potentially provides a simple test of deterministic asynchrony in a community.},

Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversity\textendash stability relationships. We first explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspecific competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species' intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species' intrinsic responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The first two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversity\textendash stability debate to a final resolution.},

We conducted a four-year~N addition experiment in an alpine meadow, using six levels of N addition rates (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32~g~N~m-2~year-1) to examine the effects of N addition on plant community biomass stability and the underlying mechanisms. We found that the stability of ecosystem aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) decreased linearly with increasing N addition rates, even though it had no effect on plant species richness at low N addition rates and significantly reduced species richness at high N addition rates. The most remarkable finding is that the main mechanism underlying ecosystem stability shifted with N addition rates. The decrease of common species stability contributed most to the reduction of plant community biomass stability under low N addition rates (N0\textendash N4), whereas the decrease of species asynchrony contributed most to the reducing plant community biomass stability under high N addition rates (N8\textendash N32). Our results indicate that species diversity was not a significant predictor of plant community biomass stability in this alpine meadow, which challenges the traditional knowledge. This study highlights the shifts of main mechanism regulating plant community biomass stability under different N addition rates, and suggests that continuous nitrogen deposition in the future may reduce ecosystem stability and potentially impeding the sustainable provision of ecosystem functions and services.},

  abstract = {Historically, food-web theory has examined the aspects of natural communities that are responsible for maintaining stability in complex communities. The two main lines of research emphasize either topological aspects damping the propagation of perturbations, or population\textendash stability mechanisms that regulate population outbreaks and prevent a total system destabilization. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that these two aspects act synergistically to produce a single conceptual framework. Nevertheless, causal relationships are still unexplored: it remains uncertain if topological patterns maintain population stability, or alternatively, if population stability promotes food-web topology. In this contribution, we explored the causal relationships between food-web topology and population stability within complex communities. We generated food webs, using three models with specific biological assumptions, and measured three population-stability variables, i.e. the proportion of locally stable three-species and four-species modules and the proportion of stable matrices; and two topological variables, i.e. modularity and degree of omnivory. We then used path analysis to evaluate two causality hypotheses, in which (i) topology promotes population stability, and (ii) population stability promotes food-web topology. We found that population stability promoted food-web topology for all models, despite the different biological assumptions. We also observed consistent causal relationships between variables, in accordance with recent literature. These results suggest that studies that intend to discuss the appearance of omnivorous behaviour or the stabilization aspect of compartmentalization, should first consider the stability of population dynamics. Additionally, they strongly support a recently proposed theory of an intrinsic mechanism to natural communities, selecting topologies capable of producing an equilibrium point where all species could coexist, and shaping natural communities to a similar and consistent pattern.

Concepts from these subdisciplines of ecology, specifically species compensation and ecosystem homeostasis, can be linked by analyzing the effect of changes in the abundance of species on ecosystem processes. Compensatory changes in species populations in response to environmental fluctuations can maintain an approximate steady state between rates of resource supply and resource consumption. We predict that ecosystem-level properties, such as species richness, total population, biomass, and energy use, will exhibit less variability in response to environmental change than will species composition. We tested this prediction using long-term data of a desert rodent community responding to natural environmental fluctuations and of a plant community responding to experimental manipulations. For the rodents, species composition was twice as variable as the ecosystem properties. This result was the same for both the analysis of variability around the 22-yr average and the analysis of variability from one time period to the next. For the plant communities, species composition was more variable among treatments in most years than stem count or species richness. Using the variance ratio proposed by J. L. Klug et al. we detected negative covariances in the rodent community, confirming the presence of compensatory dynamics.},

Moreover, the presence of meta-community complexity can give rise to a positive food-web complexity-stability effect. Spatiality may play a more important role in stabilizing dynamics of complex, real food webs than expected from ecological theory based on the models of simpler food webs.},

  abstract = {Studies of spatial population synchrony constitute a central approach for understanding the drivers of ecological dynamics. Recently, identifying the ecological impacts of climate change has emerged as a new important focus in population synchrony studies. However, while it is well known that climatic seasonality and sequential density dependence influences local population dynamics, the role of season-specific density dependence in shaping large-scale population synchrony has not received attention. Here, we present a widely applicable analytical protocol that allows us to account for both season and geographic context-specific density dependence to better elucidate the relative roles of deterministic and stochastic sources of population synchrony, including the renowned Moran effect. We exemplify our protocol by analyzing time series of seasonal (spring and fall) abundance estimates of cyclic rodent populations, revealing that season-specific density dependence is a major component of population synchrony. By accounting for deterministic sources of synchrony (in particular season-specific density dependence), we are able to identify stochastic components. These stochastic components include mild winter weather events, which are expected to increase in frequency under climate warming in boreal and Arctic ecosystems. Interestingly, these weather effects act both directly and delayed on the vole populations, thus enhancing the Moran effect. Our study demonstrates how different drivers of population synchrony, presently altered by climate warming, can be disentangled based on seasonally sampled population time-series data and adequate population models.},

Experiments and models have revealed positive, negative and no effects of diversity on individual components of stability, such as temporal variability, resistance and resilience2,3,6,11,12,14. How these stability components covary remains poorly understood15. Similarly, the effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability16, which is conceptually akin to ecosystem multifunctionality17,18, remain unknown. Here we studied communities of aquatic ciliates to understand how temporal variability, resistance and overall ecosystem stability responded to diversity (that is, species richness) in a large experiment involving 690 micro-ecosystems sampled 19 times over 40 days, resulting in 12,939 samplings. Species richness increased temporal stability but decreased resistance to warming. Thus, two stability components covaried negatively along the diversity gradient. Previous biodiversity manipulation studies rarely reported such negative covariation despite general predictions of the negative effects of diversity on individual stability components3. Integrating our findings with the ecosystem multifunctionality concept revealed hump- and U-shaped effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability. That is, biodiversity can increase overall ecosystem stability when biodiversity is low, and decrease it when biodiversity is high, or the opposite with a U-shaped relationship. The effects of diversity on ecosystem multifunctionality would also be hump- or U-shaped if diversity had positive effects on some functions and negative effects on others. Linking the ecosystem multifunctionality concept and ecosystem stability can transform the perceived effects of diversity on ecological stability and may help to translate this science into policy-relevant information.},

Idealized patterns (checkerboard, Clementsian, evenly spaced, Gleasonian and nested distributions) give the framework shape. Each pattern represents an area in a multidimensional continuum of metacommunity structures; however, the current approach to analysis of spatial structure of metacommunities is incomplete. To address this, we describe additional non-random structures and illustrate how they may be discerned via objective criteria. First, we distinguish three distinct forms of species loss in nested structures, which should improve identification of structuring mechanisms for nested patterns. Second, we define six quasi-structures that are consistent with the conceptual underpinnings of Clementsian, Gleasonian, evenly spaced and nested distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how combinations of structures at smaller spatial extents may aggregate to form Clementsian structure at larger extents. These refinements should facilitate the identification of best-fit patterns, associated structuring mechanisms, and informative scales of analysis and interpretation. This conceptual and analytical framework may be applied to network properties within communities (i.e. structure of interspecific interactions) and has broad application in ecology and biogeography.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem stability strongly depends on spatial aspects since localized perturbations spread across an entire region through species dispersal. Assessing the synchrony of the response of connected populations is fundamental to understand stability at different scales because if populations fluctuate asynchronously, the risk of their simultaneous extinction is low, thus reducing the species' regional extinction risk. Here, we consider a metacommunity model consisting of two food chains connected by dispersal and we review the various mechanisms governing the transmission of small perturbations affecting populations in the vicinity of equilibrium. First, we describe how perturbations propagate vertically (i.e., within food chains through trophic interactions) and horizontally (i.e., between food chains through dispersal) in metacommunities. Then, we discuss the mechanisms susceptible to alter synchrony patterns such as density-depend dispersal or spatial heterogeneity. Density-dependent dispersal, which is the influence of prey or predator abundance on dispersal, has a major impact because the species with the highest coefficient of variation of biomass governs the dispersal rate of the dispersing species and determines the synchrony of its populations, thus bypassing the classic vertical transmission of perturbations. Spatial heterogeneity, which is a disparity between patches of the attack rate of predators on prey in our model, alters the vertical transmission of perturbations in each patch, thus making synchrony dependent on which patch is perturbed. Finally, by combining our understanding of the impact of each of these mechanisms on synchrony, we are able to full explain the response of realistic metacommunities such as the model developed by Rooney et al. (2006). By disentangling the main mechanisms governing synchrony, our metacommunity model provides a broad insight into the consequences of spacial aspects on food web stability.},

We test this crop diversity\textendash stability hypothesis using 5 decades of data on annual yields of 176~crop species in 91~nations. We find that greater effective diversity of crops at the national level is associated with increased temporal stability of total national harvest. Crop diversity has stabilizing effects that are similar in magnitude to the observed destabilizing effects of variability in precipitation. This greater stability reflects markedly lower frequencies of years with sharp harvest losses. Diversity effects remained robust after statistically controlling for irrigation, fertilization, precipitation, temperature and other variables, and are consistent with the variance-scaling characteristics of individual crops required by theory8,9 for diversity to lead to stability. Ensuring stable food supplies is a challenge that will probably require multiple solutions. Our results suggest that increasing national effective crop diversity may be an additional way to address this challenge.},

  abstract = {Understanding ecological dynamics has been a central topic in ecology since its origins. Yet, identifying dynamic regimes remains a research frontier for modern ecology. The concept of ecological dynamic regime emerged to emphasize the dynamic property of steady states in nature and refers to the fluctuations of ecosystems around some trend or average. Identifying and characterizing ecological dynamic regimes is of utmost importance in the current context of global change since they form the reference against which post-disturbance dynamics must be compared to assess ecological resilience. However, the implementation of ecological dynamic regimes in empirical science is still challenging given the high dimensionality and stochasticity of ecological data and the large volume of data required to distinguish stochastic dynamics from general and predictable dynamics. The era of big data and the recent advances in quantitative ecology and data science offer an opportunity to study dynamic regimes using empirical approaches from a new perspective. This paper presents a novel methodological framework to describe ecological dynamic regimes from a set of ecological trajectories defined by the temporal changes of state variables in a multidimensional state space. In our framework, we formally define ecological dynamic regimes and include analytical tools to identify, characterize, and compare ecological dynamic regimes based on their geometric characteristics. More specifically, we propose different ways to identify ecological dynamic regimes from empirical data, develop a new algorithm to identify representative trajectories summarizing the main dynamic patterns, propose a set of metrics to describe the internal distribution of ecological trajectories, and define a dissimilarity index to compare two or more dynamic regimes based on their shape and position in the state space. We used artificial data to illustrate the different elements of our framework, and applied our analyses to real data, using permanent sampling plots of Canadian boreal forests as an example. Overall, our framework contributes to filling the gap between theoretical and empirical ecology by providing robust analytical tools to assess ecological resilience and study ecosystem dynamics from a multidimensional perspective and considering the variability of natural systems.},

  abstract = {Synchronous dynamics (fluctuations that occur in unison) are universal phenomena with widespread implications for ecological stability. Synchronous dynamics can amplify the destabilizing effect of environmental variability on ecosystem functions such as productivity, whereas the inverse, compensatory dynamics, can stabilize function. Here we combine simulation and empirical analyses to elucidate mechanisms that underlie patterns of synchronous versus compensatory dynamics. In both simulated and empirical communities, we show that synchronous and compensatory dynamics are not mutually exclusive but instead can vary by timescale. Our simulations identify multiple mechanisms that can generate timescale-specific patterns, including different environmental drivers, diverse life histories, dispersal, and non-stationary dynamics. We find that traditional metrics for quantifying synchronous dynamics are often biased toward long-term drivers and may miss the importance of short-term drivers. Our findings indicate key mechanisms to consider when assessing synchronous versus compensatory dynamics and our approach provides a pathway for disentangling these dynamics in natural systems.},

Enrichment can theoretically destabilize communities but effects may become weaker with increasing diversity because of the inclusion of consumer-resistant prey. Few experiments using direct manipulations of species diversity have tested these predictions. We used laboratory-based aquatic food webs to examine the effects of species composition, diversity and enrichment on temporal variability of population- and community-level biomass. We found weak effects of enrichment on population- and community-level stability. However, diversity enhanced community-level stability while species composition had no influence. In contrast, composition effects outweighed diversity effects when stability was measured at the population level. We found no negative effects of diversity on population-level stability, in opposition to theory. Our results indicate that diversity can enhance stability in multitrophic systems, but effects vary with the scale of biological organization at which stability is measured.},

Addressing questions about community dynamics and more generally temporal and spatial ecological variability requires synthetic and efficient modes of representation.

However, diversity\textendash stability relationships (DSRs) are analysed using a variety of different population and community properties, most of which are adopted from theory that makes several restrictive assumptions that are unlikely to be reflected in nature. Here, we construct a simple synthesis and generalisation of previous theory for the DSR. We show that community stability is a product of two quantities: the synchrony of population fluctuations, and an average species-level population stability that is weighted by relative abundance. Weighted average population stability can be decomposed to consider effects of the mean-variance scaling of abundance, changes in mean abundance with diversity and differences in species' mean abundance in monoculture. Our framework makes explicit how unevenness in the abundances of species in real communities influences the DSR, which occurs both through effects on community synchrony, and effects on weighted average population variability. This theory provides a more robust framework for analysing the results of empirical studies of the DSR, and facilitates the integration of findings from real and model communities.},

  abstract = {The relationships between biodiversity and stability were determined for both population and ecosystem traits in a long\textemdash term study of 207 grassland plots. Results demonstrate that biodiversity stabilizes community and ecosystem processes, but not population processes. Specifically, year\textemdash to\textemdash year variability in total aboveground plant community biomass was significantly lower in plots with greater plant species richness both for the entire 11\textemdash yr period and for the nine non\textemdash drought years. The change in total plant community biomass from before the drought to the peak of the drought was also highly dependent on species richness. For all three measures of total community biomass stability, multiple regressions that controlled for covariates showed similar significant relationships between plant diversity and stability. In contrast, year\textemdash to\textemdash year variability in species abundances was not stabilized by plant species richness for either all years or non\textemdash drought years. This difference between species vs. community biomass likely results from interspecific competition. When climatic variations harm some species, unharmed competitors increase. Such compensatory increases stabilize total community biomass, but cause species abundances to be more variable. These results support both the predictions of Robert May concerning the effects of diversity on population stability and the diversity\textemdash stability hypothesis as applied to community and ecosystem processes, thus helping to reconcile a long\textemdash standing dispute.},

  abstract = {This paper uses theory and experiments to explore the effects of diversity on stability, productivity, and susceptibility to invasion. A model of resource competition predicts that increases in diversity cause community stability to increase, but population stability to decrease. These opposite effects are, to a great extent, explained by how temporal variances in species abundances scale with mean abundance, and by the differential impact of this scaling on population vs. community stability. Community stability also depends on a negative covariance effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding (ecosystem productivity increasing with diversity). A long-term study in Minnesota grasslands supports these predictions. Models of competition predict, and field experiments confirm, that greater plant diversity leads to greater primary productivity. This diversity\textendash productivity relationship results both from the greater chance that a more productive species would be present at higher diversity (the sampling effect) and from the better ``coverage'' of habitat heterogeneity caused by the broader range of species traits in a more diverse community (the niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause more complete utilization of limiting resources at higher diversity, which increases resource retention, further increasing productivity. Finally, lower levels of available limiting resources at higher diversity are predicted to decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem to invasion, supporting the diversity\textendash invasibility hypothesis. This mechanism provides rules for community assembly and invasion resistance. In total, biodiversity should be added to species composition, disturbance, nutrient supply, and climate as a major controller of population and ecosystem dynamics and structure. By their increasingly great directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are likely to cause major long-term changes in the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. A better understanding of these ecosystem changes is needed if ecologists are to provide society with the knowledge essential for wise management of the earth and its biological resources.},

The combination of focus on efficient passive dispersers, an extensive sampling survey, large numbers of abiotic explanatory variables, information on grazing pressure, and characteristics (i.e., high connectivity and areal extent) of the study area enabled us to model roles of various metacommunity processes for guild structure and diversity within guilds. We found that water chemistry, physical habitat, and spatial variables all accounted for rather small amounts of variation in the guild structures. Diversity within each guild generally showed clear spatial patterns independent of local environmental conditions. Wave action and slope of the study sites also affected diversity. Grazing had clear effects on some aspects of diversity. Importantly, the guilds showed significant spatial patterns, suggesting that mass effects occurred at different intensities in our highly-connected study system. The intensity of dispersal was partly related to different dispersal potentials among the guilds. Different traits associated with ecological guilds may hence be associated with dispersal processes detected in systems with high connectivity among sites.},

The DNCI was tested for robustness using simulations and applied to observational datasets comprising organismal groups with different trophic level and dispersal potential. Based on the robustness tests, the DNCI discriminated the respective contribution of niche and dispersal processes in pairwise comparisons of site groups with less than 40\% and 30\% differences in their taxa and site numbers, respectively. In the observational datasets, the DNCI suggested that dispersal rather than niche assembly was the dominant assembly process which, however, varied in intensity among organismal groups and study contexts, including spatial scale and ecosystem types. The proposed DNCI measures the relative strength of community assembly processes in a way that is simple, easily quantifiable and comparable across datasets. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the DNCI and provide perspectives for future research.},

  abstract = {Spatial synchrony in population dynamics can be caused by dispersal or spatially correlated variation in environmental factors like weather (Moran effect). Distinguishing between these mechanisms is challenging for natural populations, and the study of dispersal-induced synchrony in particular has been dominated by theoretical modelling and laboratory experiments. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the evidence for dispersal as a cause of meso-scale (distances of tens of kilometres) spatial synchrony in natural populations of the two cyclic geometrid moths Epirrita autumnata and Operophtera brumata in sub-arctic mountain birch forest in northern Norway. To infer the role of dispersal in geometrid synchrony, we applied three complementary approaches, namely estimating the effect of design-based dispersal barriers (open sea) on synchrony, comparing the strength of synchrony between E. autumnata (winged adults) and the less dispersive O. brumata (wingless adult females), and relating the directionality (anisotropy) of synchrony to the predominant wind directions during spring, when geometrid larvae engage in windborne dispersal (ballooning). The estimated effect of dispersal barriers on synchrony was almost three times stronger for the less dispersive O. brumata than E. autumnata. Inter-site synchrony was also weakest for O. brumata at all spatial lags. Both observations argue for adult dispersal as an important synchronizing mechanism at the spatial scales considered. Further, synchrony in both moth species showed distinct anisotropy and was most spatially extensive parallel to the east\textendash west axis, coinciding closely to the overall dominant wind direction. This argues for a synchronizing effect of windborne larval dispersal. Congruent with most extensive dispersal along the east\textendash west axis, E. autumnata also showed evidence for a travelling wave moving southwards at a speed of 50\textendash 80 km/year. Our results suggest that dispersal processes can leave clear signatures in both the strength and directionality of synchrony in field populations, and highlight wind-driven dispersal as promising avenue for further research on spatial synchrony in natural insect populations.},

  abstract = {Synchrony is broadly important to population and community dynamics due to its ubiquity and implications for extinction dynamics, system stability, and species diversity. Investigations of synchrony in community ecology have tended to focus on covariance in the abundances of multiple species in a single location. Yet, the importance of regional environmental variation and spatial processes in community dynamics suggests that community properties, such as species richness, could fluctuate synchronously across patches in a metacommunity, in an analog of population spatial synchrony. Here, we test the prevalence of this phenomenon and the conditions under which it may occur using theoretical simulations and empirical data from 20 marine and terrestrial metacommunities. Additionally, given the importance of biodiversity for stability of ecosystem function, we posit that spatial synchrony in species richness is strongly related to stability. Our findings show that metacommunities often exhibit spatial synchrony in species richness. We also found that richness synchrony can be driven by environmental stochasticity and dispersal, two mechanisms of population spatial synchrony. Richness synchrony also depended on community structure, including species evenness and beta diversity. Strikingly, ecosystem stability was more strongly related to richness synchrony than to species richness itself, likely because richness synchrony integrates information about community processes and environmental forcing. Our study highlights a new approach for studying spatiotemporal community dynamics and emphasizes the spatial dimensions of community dynamics and stability.},

There is, however, an urgent need to extend existing knowledge to larger spatial scales to match the scale of management and conservation. Here, we develop a general theoretical framework to study the stability and variability of ecosystems at multiple scales. Analogously to the partitioning of biodiversity, we propose the concepts of alpha, beta and gamma variability. Gamma variability at regional (metacommunity) scale can be partitioned into local alpha variability and spatial beta variability, either multiplicatively or additively. On average, variability decreases from local to regional scales, which creates a negative variability\textendash area relationship. Our partitioning framework suggests that mechanisms of regional ecosystem stability can be understood by investigating the influence of ecological factors on alpha and beta variability. Diversity can provide insurance effects at the various levels of variability, thus generating alpha, beta and gamma diversity\textendash stability relationships. As a consequence, the loss of biodiversity and habitat impairs ecosystem stability at the regional scale. Overall, our framework enables a synthetic understanding of ecosystem stability at multiple scales and has practical implications for landscape management.},

  abstract = {Understanding stability across ecological hierarchies is critical for landscape management in a changing world. Recent studies showed that synchrony among lower-level components is key to scaling temporal stability across two hierarchical levels, whether spatial or organizational. But an extended framework that integrates both spatial scale and organizational level simultaneously is required to clarify the sources of ecosystem stability at large scales. However, such an extension is far from trivial when taking into account the spatial heterogeneities in real-world ecosystems. In this paper, we develop a partitioning framework that bridges variability and synchrony measures across spatial scales and organizational levels in heterogeneous metacommunities. In this framework, metacommunity variability is expressed as the product of local-scale population variability and two synchrony indices that capture the temporal coherence across species and space, respectively. We develop an R function `var.partition' and apply it to five types of desert plant communities to illustrate our framework and test how diversity shapes synchrony and variability at different hierarchical levels. As the observation scale increased from local populations to metacommunities, the temporal variability of plant productivity was reduced mainly by factors that decreased species synchrony. Species synchrony decreased from local to regional scales, and spatial synchrony decreased from species to community levels. Local and regional species diversity were key factors that reduced species synchrony at the two scales. Moreover, beta diversity contributed to decreasing spatial synchrony among communities. We conclude that our new framework offers a valuable toolbox for future empirical studies to disentangle the mechanisms and pathways by which ecological factors influence stability at large scales.},

  abstract = {Our planet is facing significant changes of biodiversity across spatial scales. Although the negative effects of local biodiversity ({$\alpha$} diversity) loss on ecosystem stability are well documented, the consequences of biodiversity changes at larger spatial scales, in particular biotic homogenization, i.e. reduced species turnover across space ({$\beta$} diversity), remain poorly known. Using data from 39 grassland biodiversity experiments, we examine the effects of {$\beta$} diversity on the stability of simulated landscapes while controlling for potentially confounding biotic and abiotic factors. Our results show that higher {$\beta$} diversity generates more asynchronous dynamics among local communities and thereby contributes to the stability of ecosystem productivity at larger spatial scales. We further quantify the relative contributions of {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} diversity to ecosystem stability and find a relatively stronger effect of {$\alpha$} diversity, possibly due to the limited spatial scale of our experiments. The stabilizing effects of both {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} diversity lead to a positive diversity\textendash stability relationship at the landscape scale. Our findings demonstrate the destabilizing effect of biotic homogenization and suggest that biodiversity should be conserved at multiple spatial scales to maintain the stability of ecosystem functions and services.},

Methods This dataset contains species abundance matrices for monthly suveys of experimental plots at Glashagh bay, Fanad, Co. Donegal, Ireland (55\textdegree 26'5''N, 7\textdegree 67'5''W) over 15 months from May 2016. We measured the percent cover of macroalgae monthly using a 25 x 25 cm quadrat with 64 intersections, positioned centrally within cages to avoid sampling edge effects. Species present within the quadrat but not occurring underneath any of the intersections were assigned a cover value of 1\%. We used the data set to~quantify six components of ecological stability, separately for both total algal cover (as a proxy for total algal biomass) and assemblage structure as measures of, respectively, functional and~compositional stability. Please see~Table 1 and methods section~in the associated~manuscript for details on calculating stability measures.~ Usage Notes Please see readme in the datafile~for explanations of experimental treatments, survey methods and species abreviations.},

  abstract = {Temporal stability of ecosystem functioning increases the predictability and reliability of ecosystem services, and understanding the drivers of stability across spatial scales is important for land management and policy decisions. We used species-level abundance data from 62 plant communities across five continents to assess mechanisms of temporal stability across spatial scales. We assessed how asynchrony (i.e. different units responding dissimilarly through time) of species and local communities stabilised metacommunity ecosystem function. Asynchrony of species increased stability of local communities, and asynchrony among local communities enhanced metacommunity stability by a wide range of magnitudes (1\textendash 315\%); this range was positively correlated with the size of the metacommunity. Additionally, asynchronous responses among local communities were linked with species' populations fluctuating asynchronously across space, perhaps stemming from physical and/or competitive differences among local communities. Accordingly, we suggest spatial heterogeneity should be a major focus for maintaining the stability of ecosystem services at larger spatial scales.},

However, the effects of diversity at multiple scales and trophic levels on ecosystem stability across environmental gradients remain unclear. Here, we conducted a field survey of {$\alpha$}-, {$\beta$}-, and {$\gamma$}-diversity of plants and soil biota (bacteria, fungi, and nematodes) and estimated the temporal ecosystem stability of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in 132 plots on the Mongolian Plateau. After climate and soil environmental variables were controlled for, both the {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-diversity of plants and soil biota (mainly via nematodes) together with precipitation explained most variation in ecosystem stability. These findings evidence that the diversity of both soil biota and plants contributes to ecosystem stability. Model predictions of the future effects of global changes on terrestrial ecosystem stability will require field observations of diversity of both plants and soil biota.},
