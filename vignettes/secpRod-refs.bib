  abstract = {Ecologists have long recognized that ecosystems are open and that they receive substantial subsidies of energy and materials from beyond their boundaries. This recognition has spurred theoretical and empirical investigation of biotic and abiotic conditions that influence the importance of subsidies for recipient ecosystems. We combined temporal patterns of resource use (via stable isotope analysis), consumer---resource stoichiometry, and invertebrate production to quantify controls on the relative importance of resource subsidies (i.e., terrestrial litter) vs. in situ food resources (i.e., algae) in fueling secondary production in a highly seasonal temperate stream. Both litter subsidies and in situ primary production were important for supporting annual invertebrate production. However, temporal patterns of secondary production and trophic support varied significantly. Algae supported the majority of production ({$>$} 55\%) during critical growth periods characterized by warm temperatures (5--15{$^\circ$}C) and high primary production. In contrast, terrestrial litter supported the majority of invertebrate production ({$>$} 55\%) during relatively cold months ({\textmu} 0--4{$^\circ$}C) when primary production and metabolic demands of invertebrates were low. A model selection procedure revealed that both temperature and consumer---resource stoichiometric imbalances were important determinants of patterns of invertebrate production. Our findings highlight the important interaction of environmental conditions and resource quality in mediating how internally and externally derived resources are used to fuel invertebrate production.},

  abstract = {Estimates of age-specific survival probabilities are needed for age-structured population models and to inform conservation decisions. However, determining the age of individuals in wildlife populations is often problematic. We present a hidden Markov model for estimating age-specific survival from capture--recapture or capture--recapture--recovery data when age is unknown and indicators of age, such as size and growth layer counts, are imprecise. The model is evaluated through simulations, and its implementation is illustrated with maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches in commonly used software. The model is then applied to genetic capture--recapture data of Florida manatees to estimate age- and time-variant survival probabilities. The approach is broadly applicable to studies aiming to quantify age-specific effects of environmental change and management actions on population dynamics, including studies that rely on minimally invasive methods such as genetic and photo identification.},

  abstract = {Individual growth is an important parameter and is linked to a number of other biological processes. It is commonly modeled using the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF), which is regularly fitted to age data where the ages of the animals are not known exactly but are binned into yearly age groups, such as fish survey data. Current methods of fitting the VBGF to these data treat all the binned ages as the actual ages. We present a new VBGF model that combines data from multiple surveys and allows the actual age of an animal to be inferred. By fitting to survey data for Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), we compare our model with two other ways of combining data from multiple surveys but where the ages are as reported in the survey data. We use the fitted parameters as inputs into a yield-per-recruit model to see what would happen to advice given to management. We found that each of the ways of combining the data leads to different parameter estimates for the VBGF and advice for policymakers. Our model fitted to the data better than either of the other models and also reduced the uncertainty in the parameter estimates and models used to inform management. Our model is a robust way of fitting the VBGF and can be used to combine data from multiple sources. The model is general enough to fit other growth curves for any taxon when the age of individuals is binned into groups.},
