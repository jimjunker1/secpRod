Description: A set of functions to move from raw data to estimates of animal population 
    and community secondary production. These functions include the data manipulation steps, 
    QA/QC, data visualisation, and estimation options to choose between estimation methods, 
    population and community levels, and annual and/or interval estimates. Secondary production 
    estimates and variability around estimates are calculated using a variation of the bootstrap 
    approach outlined by Huryn and Benke in Lamberti and Castillo "Methods in Stream Ecology".
