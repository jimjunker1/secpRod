Title: Workflow Functions for estimating Secondary Production
Version: 0.1.0
Authors: Jim Junker
Maintainer: Jim Junker<james.junker1@gmail.com>
Description: This package contains a set of functions to move from raw data to 
    estimates of animal population and community secondary production. These functions
    include the data manipulation steps, QA/QC, data visualisation, and estimation options
    to choose between estimation methods, population and community levels, and annual 
    and/or interval estimates. 
    Secondary production estimates and variability around estimates are calculated 
    using a variation of the bootstrap approach outlined by Huryn and Benke in Lambert and
    Castillo "Methods in Stream Ecology"
