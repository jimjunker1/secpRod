Title: Workflow Functions for estimating Secondary Production
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Jim", "Junker", email = "james.junker1@gmail.com",

Description: A set of functions to move from raw data to estimates of animal population and community secondary production. These functions include the data manipulation steps, QA/QC, data visualisation, and estimation options to choose between estimation methods, population and community levels, and annual and/or interval estimates. Secondary production estimates and variability around estimates are calculated using a variation of the bootstrap approach outlined by Huryn and Benke in Lamberti and Castillo "Methods in Stream Ecology"
