Data
====

data/bsc/
  Folder contains two data sets one measure by scientists and using trawl fishing gear
  (bsc_lfd_trawl.txt), which is described in 
  
  Sumpton, W., Potter, M., and Smith, G. (1994). Parasitism of the commercial sand
  crab Portunus pelagicus (l.) by the rhizocephalan Sacculina granifera boschma, 1973
  in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. Marine and Freshwater Research 45, 169â€“175.
  
  and a second from fishers using pots (bsc_lfd_pot.txt) to catch blue swimmer crabs. 
  
  Descriptions of columns headers - Initial column in just row numbers with no header
    bsc_lfd_pot.txt

      Carapace.width      - Width of the crab from tip to tip of spiny growths in mm

R program
=========

Program requires the R programming language and the setting of the path structure. The
setting of the path structure is outlined in the code itself and should hopefully 
self explanatory. 

The file mtdgm_main.R contains all necessary settings to recreate results in Lloyd-Jones
et al. ``Mixture of time dependent growth models with an application to blue swimmer 
crab length-frequency data"


mtdgm_bsc/
  mtdgm_main.R                  - Contains the R script for accessing and running the 
                                  program
  mtdgm_log_likelihood_func.R   - Function for updating the likelihood for each month                 
  mtdgm_mean_length_func.R      - Function for calculating the mean length dependent on 
                                  the parameters of the VBGM at current iteration. See 
                                  paper for more details
  mtdgm_mean_length_func_gomp.R - Function for calculating the mean length under the 
                                  Gompertz growth model
  mtdgm_pi_calc_func.R          - Function for updating the mixing proportions for each 
                                  month
  mtdgm_plot_func.R             - Function that generates plot of length frequency 
                                  distributions and fitted mixture along with estimated
                                  seasonal curve and variance function
  mtdgm_seas_integral_func.R    - Calculates the integral for the seasonal curve given psi
  mtdgm_seas_root_func.R        - Calculates the roots of the seasonal function when 
                                  the seasonal curve goes below 0
  mtdgm_var_ricker_func.R       - Returns the variance as a function of mean length under
                                  the Ricker function
